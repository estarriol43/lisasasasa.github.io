Plenty of people thinks Jamine and I are from different planets when they meet us at the first time. I'm not sure whether they are correct, but I pretty sure we accompany each others to become a better person.

When I meet Jasmine in the senior high school, she is shy and boring (In her own words not mine). I joined the Model United Nations (MUN) together and got a prize. It's cool. I never imagine that I will get prize in a MUN
